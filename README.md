# neural-network-from-scratch

## Description

This repository contains an implementation of a mini-batch Stochastic Gradient Descent (SGD) neural network from scratch using the NumPy library. The neural network is built without relying on any deep learning frameworks which aims to explain the the underlying principles and mechanics of neural networks.
